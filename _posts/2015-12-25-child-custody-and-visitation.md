# _Child Custody and Visitation_

Without question, the most difficult part of a [divorce][0]that includes children is determining who is awarded custody and what kind of visitation the other parent has. Even uncontested divorces where [property allocation][1] and [spousal support][2]are agreed upon can turn ugly when it comes time to decide which parent has primary physical custody of the children. One reason for this is because child custody impacts how much [child support][3]the non-custodial parent is expected to pay. More often, however, the fight is an emotional one because both parents love their children. Below are some of the questions the custody attorneys at Beach & Niman answer most frequently. 

**How Is Custody Awarded In California?**

Experienced family law attorneys know that the best way to resolve child custody issues is for the parents to agree to a child custody plan. Like most aspects of family law, when parents can agree to a custody schedule both parents generally end up happier, and the children are spared an extended, hurtful litigation process. So long as parents do not create a plan that is somehow manifestly unfair to the children, most family law judges will sign off on it. The guidance of a child custody attorney is very helpful in drafting a child custody agreement that a judge will approve, and your attorney can frequently include provisions for child custody into a general [marital dissolution agreement][0].

However, sometimes parents just can't agree. In this case, hiring an experienced family law attorney is essential. California family law judges have an incredible amount of discretion when awarding custody of children and, as mentioned above, this decision also impacts [child support][3]awards. Although there are guidelines as to how judges are supposed to award child custody, this enormous amount of discretion allows judges to do essentially [whatever they want. ][4]

**What Guidelines Must Judges Follow When Awarding Custody Of Children?**

The first general principle judges follow when awarding custody of children is that children generally ought to be allowed to see both parents. Only in exceptional cases where one parent is a danger to their children (such as when one parent has a drug addiction or a history of domestic violence) will a judge award custody to one parent only. This is true even where the parties were never married. Whatever you may have heard, California courts rarely give sole custody of children to the mother or the father. 

The second general principle judges follow when awarding custody of children is that they must tailor their order to the "best interests of the child." This principle is what allows such extraordinary leeway in child custody orders. Additionally, the "best interests" provision is the last bastion of fault in California family courts. While the courts are happy to grant a no-fault divorce (and, therefore, don't generally inquire as to why the parties want to get divorced), in child custody matters judges are keenly interested in the good and bad behavior of the parties. It is this 'fault-finding' process that causes parents to paint each other in the worst light possible during custody proceedings, and to accuse each other of horrible things right in front of their children. 

**How Do Judges Decide What Is In The Best Interests Of The Children?**

Judges are empowered to make a temporary custody order while the mediation phase is ongoing, and can even issue an emergency child support order where the child is in danger of immediate harm if they remain with the parent they're currently with. This "immediate harm" standard generally only applies to situations involving domestic violence or child abuse. Permanent custody orders require a longer investigation process, unless the parents create a custody agreement ahead of time.

When parents decide to litigate child custody rather than come to an agreement, the court will order mediation before making a decision. This is a final attempt at getting the parents to agree to a custody order - something judges prefer and parents ought to want once they understand what's at stake. This mediation is frequently offered as a free service to the parents, and the child custody evaluator will report his or her findings back to the judge. Generally this involves interviewing the parents individually, interviewing them together, interviewing each parent with the children present, and (depending on the child's age) interviewing the children separately. Sometimes child custody evaluators will interview friends, neighbors, teachers, doctors, and other people who can offer insight as to the family as a whole. The evaluator then provides a written report to the judge, generally 20-50 pages in length, and the judge is permitted to use this report as evidence when making his or her final determination. 

[Family Code ยง 3020][5]provides the criteria by which a judge must determine what is in the best interests of the children. The court will investigate:

* The health, safety, and welfare of the child
* Any history of child abuse or domestic violence by each parent
* The nature and amount of contact each party has with their children
* The habitual or continual illegal use of drugs or alcohol by either parent

Notably, these factors often involve evaluations of many sub-factors, including daycare issues, ethical and emotional guidance, finances, religion, the effect of children changing schools, and more. It is hardly an overstatement to say that _every _factor is important in child custody cases. The assistance of an experienced family law attorney who can persuasively make the case that your custody is in the best interests of the child is truly invaluable here. 

**My Child Wants To Live With Me. Will A Family Law Judge Let My Child Make That Decision?**

If your child is 18 years or older, then the court will. Otherwise, the wishes of the child are just another factor that the judge takes into account when awarding custody. Broadly speaking, judges often give enhanced weight to the opinions of children aged 12 or older, and less weight to the desires of younger children. It is important to remember that children are minors, and that it is the duty of their parents to choose for them what is best. 

The "12-or-older" guideline is not a rule, however. [Family Code ยง 3042][6]states, in part, that "if a child is of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent preference as to custody, the court shall consider and give due weight to the wishes of the child in making an award of custody or modification thereof." The same section permits children 14 years or older to directly address the court as to their preference, unless the judge believes it is not in the child's best interests. With the judge's permission, even younger children may address the court.

This is yet another reason why it is often beneficial for parents to come to a custody agreement rather than litigating the issue. Sometimes, even if a child really wants to live with one parent, a judge will order that child to live with the other parent, believing it to be in that child's best interests. You can, no doubt, imagine how that makes the child feel. 

**Can I Modify A Child Custody Order A Judge Has Already Made?**

Technically, yes. California courts give **strong **preference to maintaining the _status quo_. However, if a party can show that there has been a **significant **change in circumstances, then a judge will entertain a hearing to modify child custody. One such significant change in circumstances arises when the custodial parent wants to move far away, effectively destroying the visitation rights of the other parent. Other potential significant changes in circumstance include a child performing poorly in school, or the custodial parent getting remarried. 

However, a change of circumstances alone will not modify a preexisting custody order. The party seeking the modification must additionally prove that the change in custody will be in the best interests of the child. Essentially, this reopens the investigation described above. 

If you are seeking to modify a preexisting child custody order it is _c__rucial _to present a strong argument. Judges do not like reopening old cases, and generally dislike litigants that return time and again to upset an already decided-upon issue. It is far better to ask for a single modification once a significant change of circumstances warrants, and when you can show that it would be in the best interests of the child to modify the order. An experienced family law attorney, like those at Beach & Niman, can assist you with this.

**What About Child Visitation?**

Visitation is the other side of the custody coin. Even where custody is split 50/50, one party is generally referred to as a custodial parent and the other parent as having visitation rights. This makes more sense when the split is closer to 70/30, or even 80/20\. Consequently, a modification of child custody is also a modification of visitation. The court takes interference with child custody and visitation very seriously - particularly in instances of kidnapping, which can be both a state and federal crime.   
****

One special point of note: If you have been awarded custody and [child support][3], and the other party is not paying the support they owe, **do not take it upon yourself to deny that parent custody.**

Instead, seek legal help to collect the child support payments you are due. As children we learned that two wrongs don't make a right, and California courts very much take that view. There are remedies available, too, for parents who find their visitation frustrated.

Visitation is most often affected when one parent decides to move away, effectively cutting off the other parent's visitation rights. If you find yourself in this situation, please talk with us. There has been nearly 40 years of case law on this exact issue, and evaluating your question is much easier when we have the facts of your specific case. In general, however, this will be a "best interests of the child" review, much like those previously discussed.
